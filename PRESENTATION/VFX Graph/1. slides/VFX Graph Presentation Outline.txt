Presentation outline:

1. What is VFX
    - Fire
    - Fog
    - Fluid (water)
    - Spell
    - Spark
    - Projectile
    - Debris

2. How we made them
    - Particle System
    - Sprite sheet

3. How shall we make them (MAIN) = VFX Graph
3.1. DEMO
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMcPZoEc3U

3.2. Terms
    Context: Make up a chain [ Spawn -> Initialize -> Update -> (Quad) Output ]
        Spawn:
            - When to start this chain ?
            - How many particles will be emitted ?
            - When each particle will be emitted ?
        Initialize:
            - Max particles (Capacity) ?
            - Initial position, rotation, scale, velocity, ...
            - Lifetime
        Update: How will particles be updated over time ?
        (Quad) Output:
            - How to render each particles ? (mesh, material, shader, texture, color ... )
            - Facing behavior (Billboard ...)
    Block: Is used to customize context
    System: Is the chain [ Spawn -> Initialize -> Update -> (Quad) Output ]
    Node: Custom nodes to feed value to blocks

3.3. Tutorial to make a simple effect

3.4. Break down a complex effect

4. Compare with Particle System
    - CPU vs GPU
    - Better performance
    - More freedom
    - Intuitive
    - More tools (Point-Cache, Vector Field, SDF, Cancel by Distance ...)
        - Point-Cache: 
        - Vector-Field: https://github.com/OlafHaag/VectorFields
        - LOD by Cancel by Distance: https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/04/10/upgrading-vfx-in-the-fps-sample-with-visual-effect-graph/
    - Better workflow
        - Convert Mind Map into VFX Graph
        - Switch between options without losing works
        - Artist-friendly binder (example: Attractive Force)
        - Customize VFX via exposed properties
    - Pack-able support from engineers (Sub-Graph)

5. Why should I learn VFX Graph (Call to action)
    - Better particle system
    - Production-ready after 2 years in Preview
    - Want to learn Shader Graph ?
    - Want to learn Visual Scripting ?
        - Unity Bolt
        - Unreal Blueprint

6. Why should I not learn VFX Graph (yet)
    - Updated documentation is still on the way
    - Steep learning curve, comparing to Particle System
    - Only available from Unity 2018.3+ (HDRP only) or 2019.3+ (Both HDRP & URP)
